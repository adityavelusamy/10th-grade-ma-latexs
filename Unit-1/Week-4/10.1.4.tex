\section{}
Catalan Addendum Problem $a^4$: \\
Prove the number of left factors of dyck paths with $(n - 1)$ up steps is the catalan number $C_n$.
\section{}
Catalan Addendum Problem $e^5$: \\
Show that the number of Non-Nesting matchings, ways of connecting pairs of points on the x-axis using arcs
above the axis, where no arc is completely contained inside another, is the catalan numbers $C_n$.
\section{}
Consider the set of paths, $M_n$ which are always positive height and include steps of the form $(1,1), (1,0), (1, - 1)$
connecting $(0,0)$ and $(n,0)$. Form a recursion, and use it to compute $M_0$ through $M_6$.
