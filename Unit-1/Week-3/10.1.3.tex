Reading: AC 8.1, 9.1
\section{}
AC 8.8.5:
Find the generating function for the number of ways to create a bunch of n balloons selected from white,
gold, and blue balloons so that the bunch contains at least one white balloon, at least one gold balloon,
and at most two blue balloons. How many ways are there to create a bunch of 10 balloons subject to these
requirements?
\section{}
AC 8.8.8:
Find the generating function for the number of ways to distribute blank scratch paper to Alice, Bob, Carlos,
and Dave so that Alice gets at least two sheets, Bob gets at most three sheets, the number of sheets Carlos
receives is a multiple of three, and Dave gets at least one sheet but no more than six sheets of scratch
paper. Without finding the power series expansion for this generating function (or using a computer algebra
system!), determine the coefficients on $x_2$ and $x_3$ in this generating function.
\section{}
AC 9.9.10:
Find and solve a recurrence equation for the number $g_n$ of ternary strings of length $n$ that do not contain
102 as a substring.
