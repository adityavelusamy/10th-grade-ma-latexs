\section{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prove that the set, $F_T$ of real-valued functions with period $T$, meaning $f(x+T) = f(x)$, is a vector sub-space of the space of all real-valued functions.
    \item Prove that the set of all periodic functions is NOT a vector space
\end{itemize}
\section{}
Give the matrix which corresponds to the derivative operator on the set of functions spanned by $\{1, x, e^x, xe^x\}$. Then compute that matrixes null space and column space.\\

LLM 4.5.20 variation:\\
Suppose $\vec{v_1}, \ldots ,\vec{v_n}$ is a linearly dependent spanning set for a vector space $V$. Show that each $\vec{w}$ in $V$ can be expressed in more than one way as a linear combination of $\vec{v_1},\ldots, \vec{v_n}$.
